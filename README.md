# NASA_Nearest_Astroid
This web application retrieves a list of asteroids on their closest approach date to Earth.
It utilizes the Near Earth Object API provided by NASA. Refer to https://api.nasa.gov/ for more info.

This project is currently in progress. We will be utilizing Django web framework to build our application.
Important information will be posted here.

Make sure you have django installed if you want to use this application.

Once you are in the 'mysite' directory, simply run 'python manage.py runserver' and you are good to go!
